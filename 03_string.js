let Name = "Deepanshu"; //one way of defining a string

let age = new String("23"); //another way of defining strings

//Outdated way of concatenation
console.log("Hello my name is " + name + " and my age is " + 23);


//Latest way called string interpolation method
console.log(`Hello my name is ${Name} and my age is ${age}`);
